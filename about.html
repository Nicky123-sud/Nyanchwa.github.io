                <h3>Church History</h3>
                <p>
                    Nyanchwa Mission SDA Church in Kisii County started in the early 1900s when Seventh-day Adventist missionaries came to the region. They established the church along with a school and health center to help spread Christianity and support the community with education and healthcare.
                    <br>
                    Over time, the church grew, becoming an important center for worship and community services. Nyanchwa Mission has played a major role in promoting education, health, and spiritual development in the region, and it continues to serve the local community today through various programs and outreach activities.
